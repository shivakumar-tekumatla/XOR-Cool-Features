Cool Features of Consecutive XOR Operations

If you want to do the XOR operations for consecutive numbers, don't use `1^2^3^4^4^5.....^n`, it is too slow. `O(n)` . The solution from the script runs in `O(1)` There are cool properties. 

Run: 
```xor(n)```

Or if you want `98^99^100^101`,

Do :

```xor(97)^xor(101)```
